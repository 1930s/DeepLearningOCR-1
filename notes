	CS499 project: introduce deep learning as a new classifier.
	Class web page: http://selab.netlab.uky.edu/homepage/CS499fall18.htm

	I have an OCR program written in C.  It can be trained to recognize letters
	from any alphabet, any font.  The classifier I use is nearest-neighbor in a
	26-dimensional Euclidean space, where each dimension is the fill percent of
	one of the 5x5 regions of the rectangle surrounding the letter, and one
	dimension represents the ratio of height to width.  I would like to give the
	user an option to choose other classifiers.  In particular, I would like a
	deep-learning classifier.  The classifier can be written in Python, but it
	must integrate with the existing C code.  The code itself is in
	~raphael/projects/ocr/ , available in the MultiLab.
